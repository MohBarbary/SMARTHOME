 # SMART HOME Graduation project by MohBarbary

In this repository you will be able to find the code documentation, ATMEL STUDIO Project file, Proteus project, Running code screenshots and BLOCK DIAGRAMS for the MASTER & SLAVE

You can find the SLAVE program under the name slaveMainDocumentation.c, and it has been built and the .hex file can be found in the RELEASE version of the project.
steps to use the SLAVE program:
