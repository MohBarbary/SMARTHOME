 # SMART HOME Graduation project by MohBarbary


 # Important note:
The current main.c file is the MASTER program, and it has been built and the .hex file can be found in the DEBUG version of the project.
You can find the SLAVE program under the name slaveMainDocumentation.c, and it has been built and the .hex file can be found in the RELEASE version of the project.
steps to use the SLAVE program:
- Copy the master/slave code and paste it in the main.c file
- use DEBUG for MASTER and RELEASE for SLAVE or vice versa
